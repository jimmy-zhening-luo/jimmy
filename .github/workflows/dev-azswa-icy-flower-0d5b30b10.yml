          # Azure SWA workflow uses Microsoft Oryx to install Node and build SWA before deploy.
          # Microsoft Oryx does not support Node 18+, even though Node 16 etc. is deprecated everywhere lol. Great stuff.
          # Thankfully I'm very smart, so I have the privilege of being smart enough to hack/deploy my app to Azure SWA.
          # Although, one would think that a deployment tool written by Microsoft, wrapped by a workflow on a Microsoft-owned service (GitHub), to build a SWA using technologies (Vite) that are ubiquitous within Node, an ecosystem whose fate is highly intertwined with that of a Microsoft programming language (TypeScript), in which the SWA source is written, to THE Microsoft service (Azure), would Just Work (trademark) and not require the user to happen to be Big Fucking Mega-Genius like I am.
